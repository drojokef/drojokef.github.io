### ISPC
ispc compiles a C-based  [SPMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPMD) programming language to run on the SIMD units of CPUs and the Intel Xeon Phiâ„¢ architecture; it frequently provides a 3x or more speedup on CPUs with 4-wide vector SSE units and 5x-6x on CPUs with 8-wide AVX vector units, without any of the difficulty of writing intrinsics code.
Yuo can download ispc on your machine [Linux](https://github.com/ispc/ispc/releases/download/v1.13.0/ispc-v1.13.0-linux.tar.gz).
